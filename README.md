# Customer Sentiment and Trend Analysis
This repository contains the complete workflow for **Customer Sentiment and Trend Analysis**, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building predictive models. The goal is to analyze customer sentiment trends and provide insights into customer opinions and behaviors using data science techniques.

## Our tasks till now :

* MLflow setup (docker)
* preprocessing
* visualization (dashboard)
* model build
* gans
* deploy and hosting


## Repository Structure

### 1. [EDA](EDA/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis(EDA).ipynb)
- **Notebook:** `Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA).ipynb`
- **Purpose:** 
  - Conduct in-depth exploratory data analysis to uncover trends, patterns, and insights.
  - Use visualizations and statistics to understand the dataset better.

### 2. [Models](models/model.ipynb)
- **Notebook:** `model.ipynb`
- **Purpose:** 
  - Build, train, and evaluate machine learning models to predict customer sentiment.
  - Compare different algorithms and report performance metrics like accuracy and F1-score.

### 3. [Data Preprocessing](notebooks/data%20preprocessing/Customer_Sentiment_and_Trend_Analysis%20(2).ipynb)
- **Notebook:** `Customer_Sentiment_and_Trend_Analysis (2).ipynb`
- **Purpose:** 
  - Clean and preprocess the raw data for further analysis and modeling.
  - Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale numerical data.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AhmedMahmoudAZ/CustomerSentimentandTrendAnalysis.git
   cd CustomerSentimentandTrendAnalysis
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Ensure Python and the required libraries are installed. Use the following command to install necessary packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Notebooks**  
   Open Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the relevant notebooks:
   - **EDA:** `EDA/Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA).ipynb`
   - **Modeling:** `models/model.ipynb`
   - **Data Preprocessing:** `notebooks/data preprocessing/Customer_Sentiment_and_Trend_Analysis (2).ipynb`

## Workflow Summary

1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Prepare the data by cleaning, encoding, and transforming it for analysis.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**  
   - Visualize trends, explore relationships, and generate insights.

3. **Model Development:**  
   - Train machine learning models and evaluate them using key performance metrics.
