# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
### This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset for sentiment analysis. The focus of this analysis is to explore the sentiment of tweets, specifically categorizing them as positive or negative based on their content.

--------

## Dataset
### The dataset used in this analysis includes the following columns:

##### * target: Indicates the sentiment (0 for negative, 1 for positive).
#####  * stemmed_content: Contains the cleaned and pre-processed text of the tweets.
#####  * tweet_length: Length of each tweet in characters.
-------------
## Objectives
### The main objectives of this EDA are:

##### 1. To understand the distribution of sentiments in the dataset.
##### 2. To analyze the lengths of tweets in relation to their sentiment.
##### 3. To identify the most common words used in positive and negative tweets.
##### 4. To visualize the data using various plots and word clouds.
-----------
## Requirements
### To run the Jupyter notebook, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

##### * pandas
##### * numpy
##### * matplotlib
##### * seaborn
##### * wordcloud
##### * collections
------------
## Visualizations
### The notebook includes several visualizations, including:

##### * Distribution of sentiments
##### * Histogram of tweet lengths
##### * Boxplot of tweet lengths by sentiment
##### * Bar charts of the most common words in positive and negative tweets
##### * Word clouds for positive and negative tweet
